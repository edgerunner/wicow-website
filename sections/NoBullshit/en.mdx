## Realistic alerts that won't annoy you

Maybe you have tried some of those devices that claim to have something like 
99% accuracy in calving detection. You are probably reading this because you 
weren’t really satisfied with that experience.

Yes, if a system raises an alert every time the cow moves around, 
you will eventually catch the cow calving. But then that system isn’t 
really doing “calving detection”. It is simply making you do the 
hard work of checking the cow every time she moves around.

That’s why we take great care not to send you false alerts. 
We continuously train our artificial intelligence to get better 
at detecting a calving cow, while avoiding cases where the cow 
looks like she would be calving but she actually won’t.

We trust our AI so much that we feel confident enough 
to share live data from our system. Here is a summary 
of the all the calving alerts that went through wiCow.

These are real alerts raised by wiCow worldwide. This live data 
updates every time a cow calves under our watch. Still, if you 
prefer to be more scientific about it, just read the 
[research paper about our detection accuracy](/#), 
written in Dortmund University.
