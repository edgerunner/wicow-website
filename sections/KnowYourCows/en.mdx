# Know Your Cows

## You can do that right here

wiCow is a system for making sure that you
can always keep tabs on your cows, even while
you are away from the farm.

You do not even have to check anything. wiCow
will let you know if Bessie will be *calving* 
today, or if Agnes has a slight *fever*.

All you have to do is take five minutes to
install the Tsens sensor when the time is
right (which wiCow will also tell you), and
then you can rest assured that you will know
when something happens.
