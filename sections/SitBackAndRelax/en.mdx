There is a key feature in Wicow that sets it apart from anything else: 
We do not expect you to keep checking our app. We will tell you when 
you need to act on something.

More than that, whenever we can, we train and use our artificial intelligence 
to predict the future, and tell you what will happen in advance, before it happens.

The benefit for you is that you can just stop thinking about things like calving, 
insemination and fever. The time you spend on just checking on those could be 
yours to work, play or rest as you see fit.
