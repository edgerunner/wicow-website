# Simple

## Thatâ€™s how Wicow works for you.

No, really. It is quite complex in the details, 
but we want to take those details away from your mind, 
so that you can focus elsewhere. All you have to consider 
while using the Wicow system consists of three simple steps.

1. Install sensors on the cows. Wicow will remind you at the 
right time, or you can do it any time if you prefer that way. 
*It takes about five minutes to install a TSens sensor on a cow*.

2. Do other things in your farm or outside, while Wicow tracks 
your cows 7/24 using a sophisticated artificial intelligence. 
*Wicow will detect calving 24 hours before it happens*, so you 
have plenty of lead time to plan for it.

3. Take action when Wicow sends you a notification. For fever, you will know 
right as it happens, and for calving, you get two alerts, one in 24 hours advance, 
another as it begins. *Then just do as you used to do*.
