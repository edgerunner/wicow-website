# A smart investment

If you have 
*<ReactiveNumber.CowCount/> dairy cows*
in your farm, you are probably 
*losing around <ReactiveNumber.YearlyLoss/> per year* 
due to a combination of dystocia, missed insemination 
opportunities and illnesses. 

A wiCow setup with *<ReactiveNumber.TSensCount to="to"/> TSens sensors* 
is adequate to track all your cows year round, and will most probably return 
your initial investment within 14 to 16 months.

Drop your contact information, and we will get back to you
promptly with a quote tailored to your farm.
