# A smart investment

If you have 
*<ReactiveNumber.CowCount/> dairy cows*
in your farm, you are probably losing around â‚¬8000 per year due to a 
combination of dystocia, missed insemination opportunities and illnesses. 

A wiCow setup with 8 to 12* TSens sensors is adequate to track all 
your cows year round, and will most probably return your initial
investment within 14 to 16 months.

Drop your contact information, and we will get back to you
promptly with a quote tailored to your farm.
