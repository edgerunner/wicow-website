# From the horse's mouth

## Direct support from the people who built wiCow

We have a somewhat different approach to supporting our farmers.
When you have a question regarding wiCow, one of us in the core
team will be answering. We built the apps, sensors and the systems
in wiCow. We personally tested them in our partner farms. We are
the people with direct answers.

So that’s why we don’t outsource the opportunity of talking to
you.  We receive your questions directly, so that you get a real
answer right away, and we get valuable feedback to improve wiCow.

If you have any questions about wiCow, just ask us right away.
One of us will answer you as soon as possible.
